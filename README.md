🤖 AI-Powered Email Agent
This project demonstrates an AI Agent designed to automate email responses. It simulates a real-world scenario where the agent reads an incoming email, understands its context, researches relevant information, and drafts an intelligent reply — all with minimal human input.

🎯 Project Goal
The main objective of this Email Agent is to:

✅ Read and analyze customer emails

📦 Categorize them into:

Sales

Custom Enquiry

Off-topic

Customer Complaint

🔍 Generate relevant keywords based on the category

🌐 Perform simulated research

✍️ Write a first draft

✅ Review and revise the draft

🧠 How It Works
Input: A sample customer email is provided.

Categorization: Email is categorized using logic (or LLMs like GPT).

Keyword Extraction: Based on category, it generates search keywords.

Reply Drafting: AI writes a contextual draft email.

Validation: The reply is checked and rewritten if needed.
